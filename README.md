# Customer Churn Prediction for Sprint
Steps on Creating a ML Model That Can Predict If a Customer is  going to leave or not.

 1. Understand the problem, that is customer churn and understand the importance of customers retention at Sprint
    Also to undertand Sprint's objectives and their business goal.

 2. Use the historical data provided of previous customer churn behaviour
    This will help in knowing, how many customers might leave, the time range, the type of customers that might leave and what product do they buy more
    With these data, the time range on when customers leave will be provided eg, during summer or winter most people travel, On what type of customers might leave, maybe 
    students were on holidays and when the schools resume they don't use Sprint services anymore ie Airtime or Internet packages. On predicting the type of product, ie most 
    student will be using Sprint's internet package for browsing their assignment and movies etc

3. Data Prepocessing
   Understand the data that will be required in the model creation
   Clean and preprocess the data to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
   Split the data into different sets ie for training, validation, and test sets. This will ensure that you get similar churn distribution

4. Model Selection
   Choose a classification algorithm suitable for churn prediction, such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, or gradient boosting.Experiment with 
   different algorithms and select the one with the best or relatable performance.

5. Model Training and Evaluation
   Train the selected model with the most appropriate dataset. Check on the accuracy  and validate the model

6. Model Testing and Interpretation
   Assess the model's performance on the test dataset to estimate its real-world predictive power.Understand how the model makes predictions.
   The result can be present to Sprint to validate the results obtained

7. Deployment
   Deploy the trained model in Sprint for real-time predictions.

8. Monitoring and Maintenance
   Continuously monitor the model's performance in Sprint and set up alerts for unusual behavior.
   Retrain the model periodically with updated data to maintain its accuracy.
